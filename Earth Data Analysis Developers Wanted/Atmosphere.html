        <h6>The atmosphere is a gaseous envelope surrounding and protecting our planet from the intense radiation of the Sun and serves as a key interface between the terrestrial and ocean cycles. </h6>

        <p class="first-paragraph">Earth’s atmosphere is a thin veil of gas surrounding the planet. Although it only
            extends a few hundred kilometers above the surface, it contains a mixture of gases, such as oxygen and
            nitrogen, that are critical for life to exist. It distributes incoming solar radiation, protecting life
            from harmful ultraviolet radiation but also driving atmospheric circulation and weather. The atmosphere
            enables the greenhouse effect, which makes Earth more habitable. Human activity, however, is contributing
            more gases, many of which are negatively impacting the protective nature of this vital layer. NASA data
            provide measurements on weather phenomena as well as gases within the troposphere (the lowest layer of the
            atmosphere) and stratosphere (the layer above the troposphere) and their effect on air quality.
            Data products include information about geophysical processes involving clouds, aerosols, precipitation,
            lightning, chemistry, temperature, radiation balance, and dynamics. Interactions of the atmosphere with land
            and ocean surfaces along with measurements of solar radiation also fall within this discipline.</p>
        <p class="second-paragraph">Earth’s atmosphere stretches from the surface of the planet up to as far as 10,000 kilometers (6,214 miles)
            above. After that, the atmosphere blends into space. Not all scientists agree where the actual upper boundary
            of the atmosphere is, but they can agree that the bulk of the atmosphere is located close to Earth’s surface—up
            to a distance of around eight to 15 kilometers (five to nine miles).</p>
